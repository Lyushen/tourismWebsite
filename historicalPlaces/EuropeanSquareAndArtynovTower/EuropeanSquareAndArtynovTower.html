            <p>The park around the square is located in the heart of the city and is one of the favorite places for recreation. It is here that the Artynov Water Tower, the main symbol of Vinnytsia and its business card, is located.</p>
            <p>At the beginning of the 20th century, the architect Hryhorii Artynov designed it as a water pumping station for the city water supply system and an observation tower of the fire-brigade. The clock was supposed to give it a town hall-like appearance. For more than a hundred years of existence, the tower has performed various functions and changed many residents. Currently, it is a home to the Museum of Vinnytsia.</p>
            <p>Young musicians often perform on European Square, themed locations are set up during festivals and celebrations, and walking in the park is a pleasure at any time of the year. The melody of the legendary Shchedryk (Carol of the Bells) by Leontovych, which made him famous all over the world, is heard from the tower.</p>
