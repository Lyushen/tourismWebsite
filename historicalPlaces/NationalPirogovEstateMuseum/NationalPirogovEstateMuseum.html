    <h3>National Pirogov`s Estate Museum: brief history</h3>
    <p>In 1859, M. Pirogov liked and purchased the Vyshnya estate at an auction in Kyiv. He put it in order. He built the house and pharmacy in 1866. The surgeon lived and worked here for 20 years (1861-1881).</p>
    <p>On January 24, 1882, the embalmed body of the surgeon was placed in the family tomb.</p>
    <p>In 1885, the construction of the church-necropolis was completed according to the project of academician V. Sychuhov, where the sarcophagus with the body of the famous doctor is still located.</p>
    <p>After the death of Pirogov’s wife Oleksandra, the estate and the crypt were abandoned. It suffered significant damage and looting in the first decades of Soviet rule.</p>
    <p>In 1936, the Vinnytsia Regional Infectious Diseases Hospital was located in the estate.</p>
    <p>In the post-war years, the estate fell into disrepair. The question of its restoration and creation of a museum was raised several times. But the official opening of the museum complex took place only on September 9, 1947. Since then, the flow of visitors has not stopped all year round.</p>
    <h3>National Pirogov`s Estate Museum: interesting facts</h3>
    <p>The site of the pharmacy museum was once home to a real pharmacy, the first in Podilia. At one time, it sold medicines, received patients and performed surgeries.</p>
    <p>Given the museum`s outstanding role in researching and preserving national history, including medicine, the estate museum was granted the status of a national monument by a presidential decree in 1997.</p>
    <p>The estate is not just a tourist attraction: the picturesque corner attracts residents of Vinnytsia as a cozy place for walks or a great location for wedding photo shoots.</p>
    <h3>All about the church-tomb of Pirogov</h3>
    <p>An integral part of the National Pirogov`s Estate Museum is his mausoleum, the Pirogov Church-Necropolis, where the embalmed body of the scientist rests. Later, according to her will, Oleksandra, the widow of the famous surgeon, was buried there, and then her eldest son.</p>
    <p>On holidays and on special dates, to honor the memory of the famous doctor, religious services are held here, various musical pieces are played, bells ring, and each strike symbolizes the countdown of the years of Pirogov`s life. But the doors of the church complex are open every day to all those who deeply appreciate Pirogov`s contribution to the development of science and medicine and respect him as a person.</p>
    <p>How did it happen? In 1881, Pirogov died of an incurable disease. The scientist`s body was embalmed by a doctor from St. Petersburg, D. Vyvodtsev. To preserve it, Pirogov`s widow built a family crypt at the cemetery, where Pirogov`s body was moved from the village church.</p>
    <p>In 1885, a church was built on the site of a temporary chapel above the tomb and consecrated in honor of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker, according to the design of architect V. Sychuhov.</p>
    <p>After the surgeon`s wife died, the shrine was abandoned, and Pirogov`s burial place was robbed (a sword and a cross were stolen).</p>
    <p>Re-embalming in May 1945 saved the body of the brilliant doctor. Subsequently, this procedure was carried out regularly, most recently in 2018. After a long period of destruction of the body, the re-embalming specialists did the impossible: they restored Nikolai Pirogov`s appearance and significantly slowed down the decomposition process. The body brightened and acquired more natural features. It is claimed that this is the only case in the world where a body that did not know proper care was restored to the maximum extent possible 65 years after death. This work was unique in terms of its novelty, scale, and results.</p>
    <p>In 1980-1985, repair and restoration work were carried out on the church complex, and in 1992-1997 the interior was reconstructed: monumental paintings, iconostasis, etc.</p>
