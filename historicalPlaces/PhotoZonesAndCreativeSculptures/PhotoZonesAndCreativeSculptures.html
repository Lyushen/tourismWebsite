    <p>In recent years, many creative locations have appeared in Vinnytsia and immediately became a favorite photo area. Among the most popular — the I love Vinnytsia installation, a panel near Central Park, Liverpool Square, the Solar System fountain, and many sculptures, murals, and, of course, fountains.</p>
    <p>A separate street photo quest will be the search for bronze works by Vinnytsia sculptor Viacheslav Posternak: saxophonist, poet, violinist, and “philosopher in the wall”.</p>
