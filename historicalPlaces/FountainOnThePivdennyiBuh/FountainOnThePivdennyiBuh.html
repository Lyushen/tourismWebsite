    <h3>All about the fountain in Vinnytsia</h3>
    <p>If you ask what to see in Vinnytsia, everyone will say without hesitation: first of all, the light and music fountain Roshen on the Pivdennyi Buh, which was inaugurated in 2011. It is currently the largest floating fountain in Europe. According to experts, it is also among the ten most spectacular fountains in the world. The vertical jet is 60 meters high and the frontal span is 140 meters. The use of a laser projector and a water-air screen allows the demonstration of video in 3D. During the day, jets of water create an effect of harmony and tranquility, and in the evening, a grand show begins: various multimedia masterpieces are shown in front of a large open-air auditorium on a giant water canvas.</p>
    <p>The combination of classical music, dance performances and vivid stories attracts people to admire the show and makes the fountain a symbol of the City of ideas. Each thematic program is not just an entertaining water show, but a real work of contemporary art and is designed for the general public, regardless of age, gender and preferences:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>“The Little Prince” (based on the work of Exupéry about the adventure journey of the prince; combined animation, choreography and voice of the storyteller)</li>
    <li>“Elves” (invites the audience to the kind, magical world of fairy-tale elves, which is invaded by a dragon; the fight with him turns into an action, but the happy ending will delight both adults and children)</li>
    <li>“Inventions” (excitingly and vividly tells about the interesting inventions of mankind from the wheel to the newest technologies)</li>
    <li>“Swan Lake” (a combination of the classical music of P. I. Tchaikovsky’s ballet and a modern dance performance; the main roles are played by Ukrainian dancers – participants of the STB TV show “Everybody Dances” Yuliia Sakhnevych, Roman Dmytryk, Yurii Prystaietskyi)</li>
    <li>“Ukrainian” (previously called “Strings of the Native Soul”; the wonderful Ukrainian musical compositions “Two Colors”, “Shchedryk”, “My Native Land” and other performed by Nina Matvienko, Dmytro Hnatyuk, Oleh Skrypka)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The uniqueness of the Roshen fountain in Vinnytsia lies in the fact that it uses “live” river water, and not an artificial reservoir or pool. In the cold season, it is submerged under the water for the wintering.</p>
    <p>Vinnytsia’s laser show annually attracts thousands of tourists from all over Ukraine and abroad. They come in large groups, families, romantic couples and even travel alone. The equipped Roshen embankment, green areas, large-scale open-air amphitheater allows visitors to relax comfortably and enjoy storytelling video projections with lighting effects and music. The city’s location and well-developed transportation system make it easy to get there quickly and conveniently from every corner of the country, also hotels and hostels for any budget guarantee a pleasant stay.</p>
    <p>The #CityofIdeas has long proven that one day is not enough to fully experience the special atmosphere of the capital of Podilia. And while the fountain in Vinnytsia is always in the spotlight, guests of the city combine its contemplation with guided tours in Vinnytsia, visits to museums with unique collections, museums of transport and technology models, etc., as well as exciting festivals. In addition, the Vinnytsia catacombs, Vinnytsia Mures, The National Pirogov’s Estate Museum, etc., offer interesting and informative leisure activities for tourists. Among the many things Vinnytsia has to offer, the Roshen fountain is one of the favorite locations, but you will be surprised when planning your weekend, as the city is gaining more and more tourist magnets every year.</p>
