    <p>Yerusalymka — Vinnytsia quarter of Jewish artisans, the famous Jewish town baroque, which began to form in the late XVIII century. Already at the beginning of the XX century, a significant part of the population of Vinnytsia were ethnic Jews. Upper, middle, and lower Yerusalymka — this division was caused by the difference in the wealth of those who inhabited the city center: the poor or rich strata of the Jewish community.</p>
    <p>The architecture of the district is characterized by high compactness, the density of buildings, which was a characteristic feature of the living environment of the Jews of Podillia. Color and eclecticism form a special atmosphere of the quarter — the atmosphere of unhurried life and the charm of the archaic.</p>
