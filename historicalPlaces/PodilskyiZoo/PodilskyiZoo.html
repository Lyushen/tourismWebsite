    <p>Since its establishment, the Podilskyi Zoo in Vinnytsia has been constantly developing, improving its territory and enclosures, and becoming an increasingly attractive place for family recreation. Here, visitors can get away from the city bustle, feel the spirit of nature and see a large collection of animals and birds, which is constantly updated and replenished.</p>
    <p>The 8-hectare territory also includes children`s playgrounds, green corners with decorative sculptures, and the estate of the Wizard of Podilia.</p>
    <h3>A brief history</h3>
    <p>Podilskyi Zoo is the eighth and youngest in Ukraine. It was founded in Vinnytsia on December 19, 2005, on the basis of the Vinoblagrolis regional utility, which had a zoological nursery for game animals. In a few years, comfortable enclosures were built and animals were settled there. The animals were brought from zoos of Kyiv, Rivne and Mena (Chernihiv region).</p>

    <p>Since 2015, the zoo has joined the Association of Zoos and Aquaria of Ukraine, which has made it possible to share information with colleagues, buy animals, exchange valuable species, and track the pedigree of animals, which helps to improve their health.</p>
    <p>The Podilskyi Zoo team pays considerable attention to the construction of special enclosures – wintering houses, as animals from different climatic zones live here. And they try to improve ordinary enclosures every year. For example, in 2018-2019, the Podilskyi Zoo built a large bear town with a glass facade, a swimming pool with constant water filtration, sewage system, and a den where the air temperature never drops below +5 degrees. Aquatic animals have pools, and the birds of prey have models of towers from which they can watch the surrounding bustle of the zoo. And the new enclosures, which began construction in the fall of 2022 for the tiger and jaguar, also have shelters.</p>

    <p>In addition, in December 2021, the Wizard’s Manor was opened on the territory of the Podilskyi Zoo. It, as well as a new entrance group with the administrative building of the institution, were built as part of the project “Podilskyi Zoo as a Family Leisure Center” with funds from the European Union.</p>
    <h3>Inhabitants of Podilskyi Zoo</h3>
    <p>Today, the number of inhabitants of the Podilskyi Zoo is more than 260 animals and birds. Among them are camels, antelopes, deer, bears, wolves, ponies, Cameroon goats, lemurs, raccoons, meerkats, eagles, golden eagles, peacocks, pelicans, parrots, rare breeds of pigeons, swans, and many other animals. Among them are internally displaced animals as a result of the full-scale invasion of Russia.</p>

    <h3>Animal care program</h3>
    <p>In 2020, the Vinnytsia Zoo offered all those willing to become guardians for the zoo’s animals. This practice of involving the public in everyday life at the zoo is widespread in the world, as it is interesting and honorable to be a guardian and sponsor. In addition, it helps to improve the living conditions of animals and birds: the program is aimed at improving the conditions of keeping, veterinary care, and enriching their nutrition. An organization of any form of ownership or an individual can become a guardian of a favorite animal from the collection of the Podilskyi Zoo.</p>
    <p>In addition to this program, you can make a charitable donation of any amount of money on the Podilskyi Zoo’s website, which will also help the animals.</p>
