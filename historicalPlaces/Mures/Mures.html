    <p>The architectural and historical complex of Mury is an ensemble of the 17th-18th centuries consisting of buildings and walls of Jesuit and Dominican monasteries with churches. The buildings were surrounded by powerful fortress walls with buttresses, loopholes, and combat towers. The Mures became the main defensive structure of the city, which is why they were named after the Latin word murus, meaning wall.</p>
    <p>Part of the Mures with a tower has been preserved to this day. Today, the buildings of the complex house two museums, the state archive of the region, the Transfiguration Cathedral, and a technical lyceum.</p>
