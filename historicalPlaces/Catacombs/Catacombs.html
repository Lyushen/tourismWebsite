    <p>The former Capuchin monastery, built in Vinnytsia in the Tuscan Baroque style during the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, has survived many regimes and staggering events.</p>
    <p>Excursions to the dungeons of the Capuchin temple are popular among Vinnytsia residents and tourists. Vinnytsia subterrane permeates the entire historic city center. It is known for certain that the underground passages connected three monasteries of the XVII-XVIII centuries: Jesuit, Dominican, and Capuchin. Shrouded in legends and mysticism, the crypts were actually intended for evacuation during enemy attacks, burying the dead, warehouses, and brewing. Today, some of the passages are open for visitors, so everyone has the opportunity to immerse themselves in this mysterious atmosphere.</p>
