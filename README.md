# Overview
Web Development Tourism Website: __Vinnytsia City__

Author Name: Oleksii Nikitin


Differences from the Design Plan:
- The home page is about the video introduction to the city. Because the video content is the most effective element that could attract tourists
- The City History page was renamed to Cultural Sites and this page is about famous places in Vinnytsia, that are worth Visit
- Implemented additional functionality such as details of each Site that opens in overlay
- The merchandise page is still under development as it requires API implimetation

## REQUIREMENTS IMPLEMENTED

✅ Animations:

✅ Email for enquiries

✅ Navigation Done
- The navigation within the website works in a very advanced manner. It loads the separated HTML file and injects it on every webpage inside the element  "nav-placeholder"

✅ Do your image work and are they of good quality
- My images are stored locally within the project to ensure that the links will work across the time
- My next optimisation advantage is video quality. Video quality is chosen depending on the client's width and size. So if the screen of the client is less than a certain amount, the video quality will not be greater
